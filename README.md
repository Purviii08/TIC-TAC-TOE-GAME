# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other on the same device, taking turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid is filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a draw.
